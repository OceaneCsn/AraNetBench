As it is an output from DIANE, some nodes are made of several genes.
We are going to "flatten" this dataframe", so that each interaction links only one gene to one gene.

If each node is made of one gene, just skip this step.

```{r}
net <- flatten_edges(abiotic_stress_Heat_genes_net)
knitr::kable(head(net))
